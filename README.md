#### YAPCA - Yet Another Private Chat App

## What is YAPCA?
#### YAPCA stands for "Yet Another Chat App". YAPCA is a small project I'm working on in my free time to learn about end-end encryption and explore about it on my own.

## Is this a real chat app that I can use to chat with my friends?
#### Yes, this is a working chat app that you can use. Be aware that this is not the most secure chat app. Not even close to secure. The database can be modified by anyone. 
#### If you want to use it with your friends, make sure to change the firebase database linked to the app.`

## How to compile the application?
#### Import the repository into Android Studio and click on build.
